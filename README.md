# What is Aira ? 

**Aira** is an AI powered resume making assistant that can take the data (information required for the professional advancements of a person), modify the latex of the available resume templates. The usage of AI (Gemini, created by Google) in Aira comes handy when users have to write the Objective for their resume.

Aira not only writes the Objective based on a userâ€™s profile, but also clearly explains the projects (based on the 1-2 line brief given by the user). It also takes into account, the tech stack used.

The time to fill the information form might vary among users. But for that single investment of time, they get 3 (as of now) formats of resume.

<br><br>

<h1 id="back-end">Behind the screens</h1>

The backend work flow of each section is discussed clearly below.
<ul>

## Sign Up process :
1. When a user signs up, he/she (using username, email, password) will be added to *user pool* in AWS console.
2. If the user creation in Cognito is succesful, the process will continue to allot aN S3 bucket to the user. The name of the given bucket will be his/her username itself.
3. In case of any error, the account (if its created) will be deleted to avoid discrepencies in the future.
4. Authentication (While logging in) and Verfication code validation is done using cognito's very own APIs.

## Profile Updation process :
1. When a user updates his/her profile, the data will be uploaded as a JSON file in the S3 bucket. The name of the JSON file will be *your_username.json*
2. Immediately after the json file is uploaded, python functions to change the latex codes of the 3 templates will be called. These functions take the json data and modify the latex code to make it customised for each user.
3. Latex (.tex) files of all the updated (customised) resume templates will be stored in the S3 bucket given to the user.
4. So there is need to write your data into each template only when you click **Download**. It happens when you save your information itself, that too for all the 3 templates at once. So no waste of time.

    ## Usage of AI :
    1. The Objective/Summary section of the resume will be written by an AI (unless you provide an objective yourself).
    2. Also, the project descriptions will be elaborated and professionally rephrased using the AI. 
    3. The AI we have used here is **Gemini, created by Google**. The processing is done using API calls.

## Profile Viewing process :
1. If you click on the *Current Profile* button in the menu, you will be redirected to a page where you can view your saved information.
2. If no information is saved, that also can be known. 
3. So what happens when this page is visited is, the JSON file that was uploaded in S3 bucket will be fetched and the information from that file will be directly shown in this page.

## Downloading process :
1. All the saved .tex files are publicly accessible.
2. The .tex files will be written to a overleaf project using the OverLeaf API. 
3. Then you can compile your template and download it as a PDF.
4. Your resume that Aira has made for you will be in your downloads.
